# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive parking booking system that allows users to reserve parking spaces in various parking lots through a web-based interface. The system supports both regular users who can book parking spaces and administrators who can manage parking lots, spaces, users, and view booking analytics. The application includes authentication via both traditional login and OIDC providers, visual parking lot management with interactive canvas-based interfaces, comprehensive booking management capabilities, automated email reporting, timezone-aware logging, backup functionality, dynamic reporting, and scheduled operations.

## Requirements
