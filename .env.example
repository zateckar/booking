# INITIAL ADMIN USER (for first-time setup)
# =============================================================================

# Initial admin user credentials (will be created on first startup if they don't exist)
# These are only used when the database is first created
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=change-this-secure-password

# Note: After the initial admin user is created, you can remove these environment variables
# The admin user will persist in the database and can be used for subsequent logins

# =============================================================================
# SECURITY CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Force HTTPS for OIDC redirect URIs (recommended for production deployments)
# Set to "true" when the application is deployed behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS termination
# The application will automatically detect reverse proxy headers and containerized environments,
# but this setting provides explicit control when needed
# FORCE_HTTPS_REDIRECTS=true

# Environment indicator (optional)
# Set to "development", "dev", or "local" to prevent automatic HTTPS forcing in containers
# ENVIRONMENT=production

# =============================================================================
# OTHER CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# Note: All other application settings (OIDC, Email, Database, etc.) are configured
# through the admin panel interface after logging in with the initial admin user above.
# No additional environment variables are required for basic operation.
