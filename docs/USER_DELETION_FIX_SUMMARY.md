# User Deletion Fix Summary

## Problem
Users with associated bookings could not be deleted through the admin interface, resulting in HTTP 500 errors when calling `DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}`. The error was caused by foreign key constraint violations in the SQLite database.

## Root Cause
The `bookings` table had a foreign key constraint on `user_id` referencing `users.id`, but without proper cascade behavior specified. When attempting to delete a user who had bookings, SQLite would prevent the deletion to maintain referential integrity.

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Migration
- Created migration script `migrate_user_cascade_delete.py`
- Recreated the `bookings` table with proper foreign key constraints:
  - Made `user_id` nullable (`INTEGER` instead of `INTEGER NOT NULL`)
  - Added `ON DELETE SET NULL` cascade behavior for the `user_id` foreign key
  - Preserved all existing booking data during migration

### 2. Model Updates
Updated `src/booking/models/booking.py`:
```python
user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
```

### 3. Database Configuration
Ensured foreign key constraints are properly enabled in SQLite through the event handler in `src/booking/database.py`.

### 4. Behavior After Fix
- Users can now be deleted safely, even if they have associated bookings
- When a user is deleted, their bookings remain in the database but with `user_id` set to `NULL`
- This preserves historical booking data while allowing user cleanup
- No more HTTP 500 errors when deleting users through the admin interface

## Files Modified
- `src/booking/models/booking.py` - Updated foreign key constraint
- `migration/migrate_user_cascade_delete.py` - Database migration script
- `docs/USER_DELETION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Testing
The fix was verified through:
- Direct SQL deletion tests with foreign keys enabled
- API endpoint testing through FastAPI
- Confirmation that bookings get `user_id` set to `NULL` when users are deleted
- Verification that foreign key constraints work correctly

## Result
✅ Users can now be deleted from the admin interface without errors
✅ Booking history is preserved with anonymized user references
✅ Database integrity is maintained through proper foreign key handling
