# Email Scheduling Timezone Fix

## Problem Description

There was a timezone issue with scheduled email reports. When users set a time to send scheduled emails in their local timezone, the application was treating that time as UTC instead of the user's configured timezone.

### Example of the Problem

- User in UTC+2 timezone sets email to be sent at 9:00 AM
- Expected: Email sent at 9:00 AM local time (7:00 AM UTC)
- Actual: Email sent at 9:00 AM UTC (11:00 AM local time)

This meant users would receive emails 2 hours later than expected in this example.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `scheduler.py` file in the `_check_and_send_reports()` method:

```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN)
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
current_hour = now.hour  # This is UTC hour

# Check if it's time to send report based on schedule
if current_hour != settings.report_schedule_hour:  # Comparing UTC hour with local schedule
    return
```

The scheduler was comparing the current UTC hour directly with the `report_schedule_hour` setting, but the `report_schedule_hour` is meant to be interpreted in the user's configured timezone.

## Solution

Updated the scheduler to properly handle timezone conversions:

```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED)
from .timezone_service import TimezoneService

now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
timezone_service = TimezoneService(db)

# Get the configured timezone (defaults to UTC if not set)
user_timezone = settings.timezone or 'UTC'

# Convert current UTC time to user's timezone
local_now = timezone_service.convert_utc_to_local(now, user_timezone)
current_local_hour = local_now.hour

# Check if it's time to send report based on schedule in user's timezone
if current_local_hour != settings.report_schedule_hour:
    return
```

## Files Modified

- `src/booking/scheduler.py`: Fixed timezone handling in `_check_and_send_reports()` method

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

1. `test_scheduler_timezone_fix.py` - Tests the scheduler with different timezones
2. `test_email_scheduling_timezone_fix.py` - Demonstrates the problem and verifies the fix

### Test Results

The tests confirm that:
- UTC timezone scheduling works as before
- US/Eastern timezone scheduling works correctly (accounts for EST/EDT)
- European timezone scheduling works correctly (accounts for CET/CEST)
- Wrong times don't trigger email sending
- Daylight Saving Time (DST) is handled correctly

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
- Users can set their preferred email time in their local timezone
- Emails are sent at the correct local time, not UTC time
- The system properly handles different timezones and DST transitions
- Existing UTC configurations continue to work without changes

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: European User (UTC+2)
- User timezone: `Europe/Athens` (UTC+2)
- Schedule hour: `9` (9:00 AM local time)
- Email will be sent at: 7:00 AM UTC = 9:00 AM Athens time ✅

### Scenario 2: US Eastern User (UTC-5/-4)
- User timezone: `US/Eastern` (UTC-5 in winter, UTC-4 in summer)
- Schedule hour: `8` (8:00 AM local time)
- Email will be sent at: 1:00 PM UTC (winter) or 12:00 PM UTC (summer) = 8:00 AM Eastern time ✅

### Scenario 3: UTC User (no change)
- User timezone: `UTC`
- Schedule hour: `14` (2:00 PM UTC)
- Email will be sent at: 2:00 PM UTC = 2:00 PM UTC ✅

## Backward Compatibility

This fix is backward compatible:
- Existing configurations with UTC timezone continue to work exactly as before
- Users who haven't set a timezone will default to UTC behavior
- No database migrations or configuration changes are required
